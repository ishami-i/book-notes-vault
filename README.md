# 📚 Book Notes Vault

A lightweight, personal web app for storing, organizing, and searching your **book notes** — built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
No frameworks, no backend, just fast and portable code that runs right in your browser.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Book Notes Vault** helps you capture insights, ideas, and quotes from books in a clean, structured, and searchable interface.  
It stores your data locally (using `localStorage`), so your notes remain private, persistent, and offline-ready.
